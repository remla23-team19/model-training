This is a project to train a model that performs sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews.
The training pipeline is in `b1_Sentiment_Analysis_Model.ipynb`.
The inference pipeline is in `b2_Sentiment_Predictor.ipynb`.
Training data is in `a1_RestaurantReviews_HistoricDump.tsv`.

### Structure

- `/data`: contains the training data
- `/models`: contains trained models
- `/scripts`: contains all pieces of the pipeline
- `/backup`: contains old version of the repository, for reference only

### Instructions

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/remla23-team19/model-training.git
```

Install dependencies using a virtual environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: if you are using Windows, replace `source venv/bin/activate` with `venv\Scripts\activate`

Get the data via `dvc`:

```sh
pip install dvc[gdrive]
dvc pull
```

> Note: this will require you to authenticate with Google Drive, and you will need to have access to the shared folder. Therefore, the data is also available in the `data` folder. This is not normally the case (especially with large files), but we are doing this for the sake of the project to demonstrate the use of `dvc` and best practices.

This project is based on Skillcate AI "Sentiment Analysis Project â€” with traditional ML & NLP".
